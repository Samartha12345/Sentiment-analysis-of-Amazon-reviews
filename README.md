# Sentiment-analysis-of-Amazon-reviews
ðŸ“„ Description :-This project focuses on building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify the sentiment of Amazon food reviews as positive or negative. The model employs a combination of advanced text preprocessing techniques, insightful visualizations, and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
Model uses LSTM as well as Simple RNN to test which gives better results.

ðŸš€ Features:- 
Data Handling:
Data loading and cleaning using pandas.
Text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, padding sequences).

Model Architecture:
Embedding layer for word embeddings.
SimpleRNN layer for sequential data processing.
Dense layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Training and Evaluation:
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Training model with validation split and batch processing.
Evaluating model performance with confusion matrix and classification report.
LSTM Layer: Replaced the SimpleRNN layer with LSTM(64), which is better suited for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras

Results:
Achieved Accuray of 89% using Simple RNN Model
